          If you don't have any experience with Git, Learn Git first. Everybody
          uses it in real world and it is a MUST have skill in software
          development. This is a good youtube video I recommend to watch. &nbsp;

          ‚Ä¢ Click that "Deploy Site" button. Wait for the netlify to build it.
          It should be up and running in any minute now. They would provide a
          special link for your website. Usually it is on netlify.app domain.

          ‚ú® Netlify will automatically deploy your changes when you commit your

        <Title text='4. [OPTIONAL] Use your own domain' />
        <p>
          You may want to use your own custom domain. For my instance, it is{' '}
          <Code text='jbethuel.com' />.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bought mine at{' '}
          <a target='_blank' href='https://namecheap.com' className='underline'>
            namecheap.com
          </a>{' '}
          for $5. For this, you should have your credit card ready. After
          purchasing your own domain, netlify and namecheap needs a little bit
          of configuration. This guide will help you
