        <p>Hi! I&apos;m Joseph Bethuel, a Philippine-based software engineer and currently working from home.</p>
        <p>
          I have been in the industry for almost 5 years, and a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
          I have been exposed in the technology for as long as I can remember. Playing computer games for ungodly hours
          and reaped its consequences. But hey, I&apos;ve made it as a career in the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m currently working as a frontend developer for a startup overseas. I also know full stack development
          and always working on something that may improve my skills and maybe even monetize it. ðŸ˜… You can find my
          previous works on my
          <a href="https://jbethuel.com/cv">CV page</a>
          and projects in <a href="https://github.com/jbethuel">github.</a>
